# Helm API

<!--i think this file will be removed, but will wait until we go through this-->
You can access APIs for either version 2 or version 1 of the Helm API.

**Note:** The version 1 APIs are deprecated, beginning with release 3.2.1. You should use version 2 of the APIs, if possible. The Version 1 APIs will be removed from the product. See [Stabilized, deprecated, and removed function](../about/deprecate.md) for the list of deprecated function.

- [REST APIs for Helm API version 1](../apis/helm_swagger_v1.json)
