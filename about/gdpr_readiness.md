## GDPR

General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has been adopted by the European Union ("EU") and applies from May 25, 2018.

### Why is GDPR important?

GDPR establishes a stronger data protection regulatory framework for processing personal data of individuals. GDPR brings:
* New and enhanced rights for individuals
* Widened definition of personal data
* New obligations for processors
* Potential for significant financial penalties for non-compliance
* Compulsory data breach notification

## Product Configuration for GDPR

The following sections describe aspects of data management within the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes platform and provide information on capabilities to help clients with GDPR requirements.

## Data Life Cycle

Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes is an application platform for developing and managing on-premises, containerized applications. It is an integrated environment for managing containers that includes the container orchestrator Kubernetes, cluster lifecycle, application lifecycle, and security frameworks (governance, risk, and compliance).

As such, the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes platform deals primarily with technical data that is related to the configuration and management of the platform, some of which might be subject to GDPR. The Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes platform also deals with information about users who manage the platform. This data will be described throughout this document for the awareness of clients responsible for meeting GDPR requirements.

This data is persisted on the platform on local or remote file systems as configuration files or in databases. Applications that are developed to run on the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes platform might deal with other forms of personal data subject to GDPR. The mechanisms that are used to protect and manage platform data are also available to applications that run on the platform. Additional mechanisms might be required to manage and protect personal data that is collected by applications run on the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes platform.

To best understand the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes platform and its data flows, you must understand how Kubernetes, Docker, and the Operator work. These open source components are fundamental to the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes platform. You use Kubernetes deployments to place instances of applications, which are built into Operators that reference Docker images. The Operator contain the details about your application, and the Docker images contain all the software packages that your applications need to run.

### What types of data flow through Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes platform

As a platform, Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes deals with several categories of technical data that could be considered as personal data, such as an administrator user ID and password, service user IDs and passwords, IP addresses, and Kubernetes node names. The Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes platform also deals with information about users who manage the platform. Applications that run on the platform might introduce other categories of personal data unknown to the platform.

Information on how this technical data is collected/created, stored, accessed, secured, logged, and deleted is described in later sections of this document.

### Personal data used for online contact

Customers can submit online comments/feedback/requests for information about in a variety of ways, primarily:

* The public Slack community if there is a Slack channel
* The public comments or tickets on the product documentation
* The public conversations in a technical community

Typically, only the client name and email address are used, to enable personal replies for the subject of the contact, and the use of personal data conforms to the [Red Hat Online Privacy Statement](https://www.redhat.com/en/about/privacy-policy).

## Data Collection

The Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes platform does not collect sensitive personal data. It does create and manage technical data, such as an administrator user ID and password, service user IDs and passwords, IP addresses, and Kubernetes node names, which might be considered personal data. The Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes platform also deals with information about users who manage the platform. All such information is only accessible by the system administrator through a management console with role-based access control or by the system administrator though login to a Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes platform node.

Applications that run on the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes platform might collect personal data.

When you assess the use of the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes platform running containerized applications and your need to meet the requirements of GDPR, you must consider the types of personal data that are collected by the application and aspects of how that data is managed, such as:
* How is the data protected as it flows to and from the application? Is the data encrypted in transit?
* How is the data stored by the application? Is the data encrypted at rest?
* How are credentials that are used to access the application collected and stored?
* How are credentials that are used by the application to access data sources collected and stored?
* How is data collected by the application removed as needed?

This is not a definitive list of the types of data that are collected by the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes platform. It is provided as an example for consideration. If you have any questions about the types of data, contact Red Hat.


## Data storage

The Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes platform persists technical data that is related to configuration and management of the platform in stateful stores on local or remote file systems as configuration files or in databases. Consideration must be given to securing all data at rest. The Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes platform supports encryption of data at rest in stateful stores that use `dm-crypt`.

The following items highlight the areas where data is stored, which you might want to consider for GDPR.

* **Platform Configuration Data:** The Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes platform configuration can be customized by updating a configuration YAML file with properties for general settings, Kubernetes, logs, network, Docker, and other settings. This data is used as input to the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes platform installer for deploying one or more nodes. The properties also include an administrator user ID and password that are used for bootstrap. For more information, see [Customizing the cluster](../installer/3.2.2/config_yaml.md).
* **Kubernetes Configuration Data:** Kubernetes cluster state data is stored in a distributed key-value store, `etcd`. 
* **User Authentication Data, including User IDs and passwords:** User ID and password management are handled through a client enterprise LDAP directory. Users and groups that are defined in LDAP can be added to Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes platform teams and assigned access roles. Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes platform stores the email address and user ID from LDAP, but does not store the password. Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes platform stores the group name and upon login, caches the available groups to which a user belongs. Group membership is not persisted in any long-term way. Securing user and group data at rest in the enterprise LDAP must be considered. Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes platform also includes an authentication service, Open ID Connect (OIDC) that interacts with the enterprise directory and maintains access tokens. This service uses MongoDB as a backing store.
* **Service authentication data, including user IDs and passwords:** Credentials that are used by Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes platform components for inter-component access are defined as Kubernetes Secrets. All Kubernetes resource definitions are persisted in the `etcd` key-value data store. Initial credentials values are defined in the platform configuration data as Kubernetes Secret configuration YAML files. For more information, see [Managing Secrets](../applications/managing_secrets.md).

## Data access

Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes platform data can be accessed through the following defined set of product interfaces.
* Web user interface (the console)
* Kubernetes `kubectl` CLI
* Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes CLI
* oc CLI

These interfaces are designed to allow you to make administrative changes to your Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes cluster. Administration access to Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes can be secured and involves three logical, ordered stages when a request is made: authentication, role-mapping, and authorization.

### Authentication

The Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes platform authentication manager accepts user credentials from the console and forwards the credentials to the backend OIDC provider, which validates the user credentials against the enterprise directory. The OIDC provider then returns an authentication cookie (`auth-cookie`) with the content of a JSON Web Token (`JWT`) to the authentication manager. The JWT token persists information such as the user ID and email address, in addition to group membership at the time of the authentication request. This authentication cookie is then sent back to the console. The cookie is refreshed during the session. It is valid for 12 hours after you sign out of the console or close your web browser.

For all subsequent authentication requests made from the console, the front-end NGINX server decodes the available authentication cookie in the request and validates the request by calling the authentication manager. <!--nginx is not used, correct? I think this paragraph should be removed-->

The Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes platform CLI requires the user to provide credentials to log in.

The `kubectl` and `oc` CLI also requires credentials to access the cluster. These credentials can be obtained from the management console and expire after 12 hours. Access through service accounts is supported.

### Role Mapping

Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes platform supports role-based access control (RBAC). In the role mapping stage, the user name that is provided in the authentication stage is mapped to a user or group role. The roles are used when authorizing which administrative activities can be carried out by the authenticated user.

### Authorization

Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes platform roles control access to cluster configuration actions, to catalog and Helm resources, and to Kubernetes resources. Several IAM (Identity and Access Management) roles are provided, including Cluster Administrator, Administrator, Operator, Editor, Viewer. A role is assigned to users or user groups when you add them to a team. Team access to resources can be controlled by namespace.

### Pod Security

Pod security policies are used to set up cluster-level control over what a pod can do or what it can access. 

## Data Processing

Users of Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes can control the way that technical data that is related to configuration and management is processed and secured through system configuration.

**Role-based access control** (RBAC) controls what data and functions can be accessed by users.

**Data-in-transit** is protected by using `TLS`. `HTTPS` (`TLS` underlying) is used for secure data transfer between user client and back end services. Users can specify the root certificate to use during installation. 

**Data-at-rest** protection is supported by using `dm-crypt` to encrypt data.

These same platform mechanisms that are used to manage and secure Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes platform technical data can be used to manage and secure personal data for user-developed or user-provided applications. Clients can develop their own capabilities to implement further controls.

## Data Deletion

Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes platform provides commands, application programming interfaces (APIs), and user interface actions to delete data that is created or collected by the product. These functions enable users to delete technical data, such as service user IDs and passwords, IP addresses, Kubernetes node names, or any other platform configuration data, as well as information about users who manage the platform.

Areas of Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes platform to consider for support of data deletion:

* All technical data that is related to platform configuration can be deleted through the management console or the Kubernetes `kubectl` API.

Areas of Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes platform to consider for support of account data deletion:
* All technical data that is related to platform configuration can be deleted through the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes or the Kubernetes `kubectl` API.

Function to remove user ID and password data that is managed through an enterprise LDAP directory would be provided by the LDAP product used with Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes platform.

## Capability for Restricting Use of Personal Data

Using the facilities summarized in this document, Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes platform enables an end user to restrict usage of any technical data within the platform that is considered personal data.

Under GDPR, users have rights to access, modify, and restrict processing. Refer to other sections of this document to control the following:
* Right to access
  * Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes platform administrators can use Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes platform features to provide individuals access to their data.
  * Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes platform administrators can use Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes platform features to provide individuals information about what data Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes platform holds about the individual.
* Right to modify
  * Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes platform administrators can use Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes platform features to allow an individual to modify or correct their data.
  * Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes platform administrators can use Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes platform features to correct an individual's data for them.
* Right to restrict processing
  * Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes platform administrators can use Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes platform features to stop processing an individual's data.

## Appendix
