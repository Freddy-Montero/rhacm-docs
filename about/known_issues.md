## Certificate manager must not exist during an installation

When certificate manager already exists on the cluster, Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes installation fails.

   ```
   kubectl get crd | grep certificates.certmanager
   ```

## LDAP user names are case-sensitive

LDAP user names are case-sensitive. You must use the name exactly the way it is configured in your LDAP directory.

   ```
   CIS policy controller is not installed
   ```

You must enable the CIS policy controller. For more information, see _Enable the CIS controller_ on the [CIS policy controller page](../governance/cis_policy_ctrl.md#cis-policy-controller-page).
