There are some services that are installed <!--verify that this is valid for logging-->, but not enabled by default. You can enable them by activating them in the `config.yaml` file. The following table shows the services that are installed, but not enabled by default:

|Service|Description|Required|
|--------|-----------|-------------------|
|logging| Supported by Elasticsearch, Logstash, Filebeat, and Kibana. Collects container logs from `stdout`, `stderr`, and custom file definitions within the container and ensures that all data in transit is TLS-secured using secure ciphers that meet requirements. Ensures that all data is encrypted at rest using secure ciphers that meet requirements. | No, unless you are bundling Kibana dashboards or invoking logging APIs. |
