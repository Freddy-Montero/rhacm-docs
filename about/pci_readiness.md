# {{site.data.keyword.product}} platform considerations for PCI readiness

Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a collection of objectives and corresponding requirements for securing a cardholder data environment. The cardholder data environment, as defined by the PCI Security Standards Council, is the “people, processes, and technology that store, process, or transmit cardholder data or affect the security of cardholder data.” The DSS is broken out into 6 control objectives and 12 top-level requirements.

IBM engaged a third-party QSA firm, Weaver (who works with various aspects of IBM Cloud) to review the {{site.data.keyword.product_tm}} platform and develop PCI guidelines for {{site.data.keyword.product}} users. The result is a white paper that outlines considerations and guidance for organizations that are considering the {{site.data.keyword.product}} platform and how it can help support the implementation of PCI DSS 3.2.1 requirements. Each client is responsible for determining whether their specific {{site.data.keyword.product}} environment and configuration meets Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) requirements.
