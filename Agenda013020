Mikela looking into ASCIIDoc


Updates from Red Hat meeting with Dawn, Ali, and Juliana:
Culture is similar, but has a certain factor that no one can seem to explain. It is more open to idea expression. They were happy with how things go.
  They are open to our way of working, at least at the beginning. They are understanding and supportive of the changes, and don't want to force us into a tailspin with too much change.
Red Hat has a centralized ID team.
  When geographically possible, they sit near the developers. Space is very limited, so sometimes the best you can get is on a different floor of the same location.
  Under the OpenShift line of business
  Similar to squad structure. About 28 squads, but not all need documentation. Not 1 ID to 1 squad. 
  Content strategist works closely with customers and has the overview of the documentation branding.
  Writers work more with internal teams, though I want to know if we can have some access to customer interaction.
  Builds:
     They refresh daily using Pantheon. 
     There is a build focal, and builds are automated. 
     OpenShift builds in two different places, with single-sourcing.
  Translation: 
     JA mostly, but sometimes KO and zh_CN. They have someone who handles this. 
  Writing:
     AsciiDoc is what they use for source
     Files in public Git repo
     Jira and Bugzilla for issues
     Topic-based
     Conditional processing, I think
