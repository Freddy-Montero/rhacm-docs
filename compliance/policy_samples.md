# Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes policy samples

View a description of the the policy samples that are included in your Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes installation.

* [Memory usage policy](#limit_mem) 
* [Namespace policy](#namespace)
* [Network policy](#network)
* [Pod nginx policy](#pod_nginx)
* [Pod security policy](#psp)
* [Role policy](#role)
* [Rolebinding policy](#rbind_policy)


**Note**: You must create a placement policy and placement binding policy to apply your policies on to your cluster. For more information, see [Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes policy example](../compliance/policy_example.md).

## Memory usage policy
{: #limit_mem}

Apply the limit range policy to limit your memory usage. Your memory usage policy might resemble the following YAML file:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: policy.mcm.ibm.com/v1alpha1
   kind: Policy
   metadata:
     name: policy-limitrange
     namespace: mcm 
   spec:
     complianceType: musthave
     remediationAction: inform
     namespaces:
       exclude: ["kube-*"]
       include: ["default"]
     object-templates:
       - complianceType: musthave
         objectDefinition:
           apiVersion: v1
           kind: LimitRange # limit memory usage
           metadata:
             name: mem-limit-range
           spec:
             limits:
             - default:
                 memory: 512Mi
               defaultRequest:
                 memory: 256Mi
