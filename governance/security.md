# Security

Manage security and role-based access control (RBAC) of Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes components.

## Authentication

You can onboard workloads to Identity and Access Management (IAM). You must configure authentication service requirements for  Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes. For more information, see _Understanding authentication_ in [OpenShift Container Platform documentation](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/authentication/understanding-authentication.html).

## Role-based access control (RBAC)

Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes supports several roles. Your role determines the actions that you can perform. Kubernetes offers role-based access control (RBAC) authorization mechanisms, so users of the cluster platform can be grouped into teams and have namespaces dedicated to teams. For more information about RBAC, see the _RBAC_ overview in the [OpenShift Container Platform documentation](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/authentication/using-rbac.html). View the following RBAC tables for components in Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes:
