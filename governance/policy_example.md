# Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes policy example

Each Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes policy can have at least one or multiple templates. For more details about the policy elements, see [Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes policy overview](../governance/policy_overview.md).
  
The policy requires a _PlacementPolicy_ that defines the clusters that the policy document is applied to, and a _PlacementBinding_ that binds the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes policy to the `PlacementPolicy`. View the example placement policy and placement binding: 

   * Example placement policy that selects clusters based on a label:
      
      ```yaml
      apiVersion: mcm.ibm.com/v1alpha1
      kind: PlacementPolicy
      metadata:
        name: placement1
        namespace: mcm
      spec:
        clusterLabels:
          matchLabels:
            cloud: IBM
      ```
 
   * Example placement binding that binds the placement policy and the policy document:
     
     ```yaml
     apiVersion: mcm.ibm.com/v1alpha1
     kind: PlacementBinding
     metadata:
       name: binding1
       namespace: mcm
     placementRef:
       name: placement1
       kind: PlacementPolicy
       apiGroup: mcm.ibm.com
     subjects:
     - name: policy1
       kind: Policy
       apiGroup: policy.mcm.ibm.com
     ```

  **Important**: The `PlacementPolicy` and `PlacementBinding` can be included in the same `.yaml` file or separate `.yaml` files.
