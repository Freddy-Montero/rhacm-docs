# Certificate policy controller

Certificate policy controller can be used to receive notifications about non-compliant certificate policies.
{:shortdesc}

The certificate policy controller communicates with the local Kubernetes API server to get the list of secrets that contain certificates and determine all non-compliant certificates.

The Security Advisor Findings API report all non-compliant policies that include certificate policies. See the [{{site.data.keyword.mcm}} security findings](../manage_cluster/security_advisor.md) for more information.

## Certificate policy
  
A `CertificatePolicy` is a CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) instance that contains the specifications of which certificates to monitor and refresh. For more information about CRDs, see [Extend the Kubernetes API with CustomResourceDefinitions ![Opens in a new tab](../../images/icons/launch-glyph.svg "Opens in a new tab")](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-kubernetes-api/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/){: new_window}.

You must create a certificate policy controller to create a certificate policy. For more information, see the known issue topic, [Mapping error for a certificate policy](../../about/known_issues.md#mappingcert).

### Parent policy for the certificate policy 

A certificate policy can be either created directly on your managed cluster, or on your hub cluster if it manages your managed cluster. Your managed cluster must be an {{site.data.keyword.mcm_notm}} with the required services. For more information about the services, see [Administering](../../admin/intro.md). If {{site.data.keyword.mcm_notm}} is not installed, you can create a certificate policy directly on your managed cluster by running the following command: `kubectl create -f certificatePolicyFile.yaml`.

If {{site.data.keyword.mcm_notm}} is installed, create a parent policy that includes the certificate policy to be propagated to the managed cluster.

  View the following example description of a certificate policy and review the element descriptions of the certificate policy:

  ```yaml
  Name:         certificate-policy-example
  Namespace:    default
  Labels:       category=system-and-information-integrity
  APIVersion:  policies.ibm.com/v1alpha1
  Kind:         CertificatePolicy

        kube-system
      Include:

  ```
  {: pre}
  
  **Note:** In a certificate policy, the `category=system-and-information-integrity` label categorizes the policy and facilitates querying the certificate policies. If there is a different value for the `category` key in your certificate policy, the value is overridden by the certificate controller.

### Certificate policy elements

The `namespaceSelector` defines which namespaces are subject to the enforcement of the certificate policy. A single certificate policy can be applied to multiple namespaces. For example, if there are two certificate policies with same value for the `namespaceSelector` parameter, only the first policy is applied to the specified namespace.

  View the following YAML example of the `namespaceSelector` parameter in a certificate policy that is applied to multiple namespaces:

   ```yaml
   spec:
     namespaceSelector:
          include: ["default", "kube-*"]
          exclude: ["kube-system"]
   ```
  {: pre}

The `minimumDuration` parameter specifies the smallest duration before a certificate is considered non-compliant. When the certificate expiration is greater than the `minimumDuration`, then the certificate is considered compliant. View the following YAML example of the `minimumDuration` parameter in a certificate policy: 

  ```yaml
  remediationAction: enforce
  disabled: false
  minimumDuration: 200h
  ```
  {: pre}

  The default value for `minimumDuration` is 30 days (672h).

## Creating a certificate policy

You can create a YAML file for your certificate policy or create a certificate policy from the {{site.data.keyword.gui}}. View the following sections to create a certificate policy:

* [Creating a YAML file for a certificate policy](#yaml)
* [Creating a certificate policy from the {{site.data.keyword.gui}}](#policy_gui)

### Creating a YAML file for a certificate policy
{: #yaml}

Complete the following steps to create a certificate policy from the command line interface (CLI):

1. Create a YAML file for your certificate policy. See [Creating a YAML file for an {{site.data.keyword.mcm_notm}} policy](../compliance/create_policy.md#yaml) for more information on policy requirements. 

    Your certificate policy might resemble the following policy:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: policies.ibm.com/v1alpha1
    kind: CertificatePolicy
    metadata:
      name: certificate-policy-1
      namespace: kube-system
      label:
        category: "System-Integrity"
    spec:
      # include specifies the namespaces in which you want to watch certificates, while exclude specifies the namespaces you explicitly do not want to watch
      namespaceSelector:
        include: ["default", "kube-*"]
        exclude: ["kube-system"]
      # This parameter value can be "enforce" or "inform", however "enforce" does not do anything with regards to this controller
      remediationAction: inform
      # minimum duration is the least amount of time the certificate is still valid from the time the controller checks the policy compliance
      minimumDuration: 100h
    ```
    {: codeblock} 
    
2. Apply the policy by running the following command:
   
   ```
   kubectl apply -f <certificate-policy-file-name>  --namespace=<mcm_namespace>
   ```
   {: codeblock}
   
3. Verify and list the policies by running the following command:

   ```
   kubectl get certificatepolicy --namespace=<mcm_namespace>
   ```
   {: codeblock}
   
Your certificate policy is created.

#### Viewing your certificate policy

Complete the following steps to view your certificate policy from the CLI:

1. View details for a specific certificate policy by running the following command:
   
   ```
   kubectl get certificatepolicy <policy-name> -n <mcm_namespace> -o yaml
   ```
   {: codeblock}
   
2. View a description of your certificate policy by running the following command:

   ```
   kubectl describe certificatepolicy <name> -n <namespace>
   ```
   {: codeblock}

### Create a certificate policy from the {{site.data.keyword.gui}}
{: #policy_gui}

1. Log in to your cluster from the {{site.data.keyword.gui}}.
2. From the navigation menu, click **Governance and risk**
3. Click **Create policy**.
4. Enter or select the appropriate values for the following fields:
   * Name
   * Specifications
   * Cluster selector
   * Remediation action
   * Standards
   * Categories
   * Controls
   * Disabled

5. Click **Create**.

A certificate policy is created and the `CertificatePolicy` definition within it will look similar to the following YAML.

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: policies.ibm.com/v1alpha1
   kind: CertificatePolicy
   metadata:
     name: certificate-policy-1
     namespace: kube-system
     label:
       category: "System-Integrity"
   spec:
   # include parameter values are the namespaces you want to watch certificates in; exclude parameter values are the namespaces you explicitly do not want to watch
     namespaceSelector:
       include: ["default", "kube-*"]
       exclude: ["kube-system"]
     # This parameter value can be "enforce" or "inform", however "enforce" does not do anything with regards to this controller.
     remediationAction: inform
     # minimum duration is the least amount of time the certificate is still valid from the time the controller checks the policy compliance
     disabled: false
     minimumDuration: 100h
   ```
   {: codeblock}

#### View your certificate policy

You can view any certificate policy and its status from the {{site.data.keyword.gui}}.

1. Log in to your cluster from the {{site.data.keyword.gui}}.
2. From the navigation menu, click **Governance and risk**. 
3. Click the _Policies_ tab to view a summary of your policies and a table list of your policies.
   **Note**: You can filter the table list of your policies by selecting the _All policies_ tab or _Cluster violations_ tab. 
4. Select one of your policies.


For more information about other policy controllers, see [{{site.data.keyword.mcm_notm}} policy controllers](../compliance/policy_controllers.md). See [{{site.data.keyword.mcm_notm}} Governance and risk](../compliance/compliance_intro.md) for more information about policies.

## Bringing your own certificates

You can monitor your own certificates with the certificate policy controller. You must complete one of the following requirements to monitor your own certificates:

* Create a Kubernetes TLS Secret for your certificate
* Add the label `certificate_key_name` into your Kubernetes secret

### Creating a Kubernetes TLS secret

Create a Kubernetes TLS secret to monitor your own certificates by running the following command: 
   
   ```
   kubectl -n <namespace> create secret tls <secret name> --cert=<path to certificate>/<certificate name> --key=<path to key>/<key name>
   ```
   {: codeblock}
   
   View the following descriptions of the parameters you must update for your TLS secret:
 
   * `<namespace>`: The namespace where you want your certificate secret to be. 
   * `<secret name>`: The name of your Kubernetes Secret.
   * `<path to certificate>`: The folder that contains the certificate on your local file system.
   * `<certificate name>`: The name of the certificate file on your file system.
   * `<path to key>`: The folder that contains the private key of your certificate on your local file system. 
   * `<key name>`: The name of your private key file on your file system.

  
### Adding a label into your Kubernetes secret 

You can also monitor your own certificates with the certificate policy controller by adding the `certificate_key_name` label for your certificate key.

Update the `metadata` parameter in your TLS Secret by adding the `certificate_key_name` label. Run the following command to add the `certificate_key_name` label: 

   ```
   kubectl label secret my-certificate -n default certificate_key_name=cert
   ```
   {: codeblock}
   
   Your updated TLS Secret might resemble the following content:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Secret
   metadata:
     name: my-certificate
     namespace: default
     labels:
       certificate_key_name: cert
   type: Opaque
   data:
     cert: <Certificate Data>
     key: <Private Key Data>
   ```
   {: codeblock}
   
The certificate policy controller can monitor your own certificates.
