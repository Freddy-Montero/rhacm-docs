## Troubleshooting cert-manager-webhook
{: #webhook}

Cert-manager is deployed with a webhook to support RBAC and provide extra validation when `cert-manager` resources are created.
### Symptom

You might see one of the following errors.
```
error: unable to retrieve the complete list of server APIs: admission.certmanager.k8s.io/v1beta1: Unauthorized
```
{: codeblock}

```
failed calling webhook "certificates.admission.certmanager.k8s.io": the server is currently unable to handle the request
```
{: codeblock}

### Resolving the problem

1. Check the following items.
    - Run the following command to see whether the `webhook` and `cainjector` pods are available.

      ```
      # Get the pod names and status
      kubectl get pods -n cert-manager | grep webhook
      ```
      {: codeblock}

    - If the pods are not available, run the following command on each pod and note the errors.
      ```
      kubectl describe <pod name> -n cert-manager
      ```
      {: codeblock}

    - If the pods are missing volume mounts or secrets, check the `cert-manager` namespace for messages that resemble the following.
      ```
      Unable to mount volumes for pod "cert-manager-webhook-ibm-cert-manager-webhook-998687778-4tmlz_cert-manager(52d4e997-ce58-11e9-94c3-06ad18c6690e)": timeout expired waiting for volumes to attach or mount for pod "cert-manager"/"cert-manager-webhook-ibm-cert-manager-webhook-998687778-4tmlz". list of unmounted volumes=[certs]. list of unattached volumes=[certs default-token-8gsfx]
      ```
      {: codeblock}

      ```
      MountVolume.SetUp failed for volume "certs" : secrets "cert-manager-webhook-ibm-cert-manager-webhook-webhook-tls" not found
      ```
      {: codeblock}

    - Does the namespace have the label `certmanager.k8s.io/disable-validation=true` on it?

      ```
      # View the cert-manager namespace
      kubectl describe namespace cert-manager
      ```
      {: codeblock}

      The resulting output is similar to the following example. Notice the label.

      ```
      $ kubectl describe namespace cert-manager
       Name:         cert-manager
       Labels:       certmanager.k8s.io/disable-validation=true
                 icp=system
       Annotations:  mcm.ibm.com/accountID: id-mycluster-account
                 mcm.ibm.com/type: System
       Status:       Active
       No resource quota.

       Resource Limits
       Type       Resource  Min  Max   Default Request  Default Limit  Max Limit/Request Ratio
       ----       --------  ---  ---   ---------------  -------------  -----------------------
       Container  cpu       0    800m  300m             800m           -
       Container  memory    0    1Gi   300Mi            1Gi            -
      ```
      {: codeblock}

    - If the label is not on the namespace, add the label and restart the `cert-manager` webhook pods.
      ```
      # Add the label
      kubectl label namespace cert-manager certmanager.k8s.io/disable-validation=true
      ```
      {: codeblock}

      ```
      kubectl delete <pod name> -n cert-manager
      ```
      {: codeblock}

    - If the label does exist on the namespace, check the normal `cert-manager` pods and `cert-manager` logs. Are the pods up and running? Are there any errors in the logs?

      ```
      # Get the pod names and statuses
      kubectl get pods -n cert-manager

      # Logs
      kubectl logs -n cert-manager <pod name>
      ```
      {: codeblock}

2. If step 1 does not apply, and everything is up and running, then restart the webhook pods.
   ```
   kubectl delete <pod name> -n cert-manager
   ```
   {: codeblock}

3. If you still face errors, then check the Kubernetes apiserver.
    - Is the apiserver active?
    - Are requests sent by the apiserver?
    - Is the `ValidatingAdmissionWebhook` enabled?
         - For non-{{site.data.keyword.cloud_pak_mcm}} environments, check to see whether you specified `--enable-admission-plugins=` in `kube_apiserver_extra_args` in your `config.yaml`. If you did not, then no need to worry. If you did, make sure `ValidatingAdmissionWebhook` is present in the list.
         - For {{site.data.keyword.open_s}} environments, check the `master-config.yaml`. If `admissionConfig.pluginConfig` does not contain `ValidatingAdmissionWebhook`, you must add it.

4. As a last resort, uninstall the webhook to disable it.
   ```
   helm delete cert-manager-webhook --purge --tls
   ```
   {: codeblock}

   **NOTE**: If you uninstall the webhook, you lose the functions that the webhook provides, which is validating the cert-manager resources and preventing non-cluster administrators from using `ClusterIssuers` to issue their certificates.
