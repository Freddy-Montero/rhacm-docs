# Support types

IBM offers different levels of support for the different offerings, and if you need more support, you can purchase support plans.

IBM offers high-quality support plans for the different enterprise product bundles. Access to the vast support team is included with your purchase. You can access the IBM Support team through the [support page ![Opens in a new tab](../../images/icons/launch-glyph.svg "Opens in a new tab")](https://ibm.biz/icpsupport){: new_window}

If you purchased an enterprise product bundle, you can also purchase Premium Support. This plan offers faster responsiveness, higher priority for support cases, and a named client success manager to help make you more successful.
