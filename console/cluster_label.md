# Managing cluster labels

Add a label to your cluster to select group resources. See [Labels and Selectors](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/) for more information.

You can add new labels, remove existing labels, and edit existing labels for your clusters. Complete the following steps to manage your labels:

1. From the navigation menu, click **Automate infrastructure** > **Clusters**.

2. Find your cluster in the _Clusters_ table.

3. Click the **Options** icon to see more.

4. Click **Edit Labels**.

5. From the _Manage Labels_ dialog box, assign your label a value. After you assign a value, your label might resemble the following:

  ```
  environment=Dev
  ```
6. Click **Save**.

- If you want to remove an existing label, select a label and click the **Remove an item** icon.

- If you want to update an existing label, select and edit the label. After editing your label, click the **Add a new item** icon.

    Your label is updated.

  Your created labels appear in the _Labels_ column.

**Note** You can also edit a cluster label from the cluster _Overview_ page by clicking **Actions** > **Edit labels** or the _Label edit_ button.
