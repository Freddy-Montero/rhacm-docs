# Event management

You can visualize and manage multiple clusters when you install Event Management. By using Event Management, you can consolidate information from your monitoring systems and address problems. Events indicate that something happened on an application, service, or another monitored object. All events that are related to a single application, or to a particular cluster, are correlated with an incident. Event Management can receive events from various monitoring sources, either on-premises or in the cloud.
