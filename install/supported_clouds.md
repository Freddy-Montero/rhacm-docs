# Supported managed cloud providers

Learn about the cloud providers that are available with Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes. Also, find the documented managed providers that are available.

  - [Supported cloud providers](#providers)
  - [Supported managed cluster cloud providers](#providers-managed)
  - [Configuring kubectl](#kubectl)

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.2 and 4.3 are supported for the hub cluster and managed clusters.

**Best practice:** For managed cluster cloud providers, use latest version of Kubernetes.

From each cloud provider documentation, you might need to learn how configure your `kubectl`. You must have `kubectl` installed.

Each cloud provider process to configure `kubectl` is different, so view the product documentation for details.
