# Supported managed providers

Learn about the cloud providers that are available with Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes. Also, find the documented managed providers that are available.

  - [Supported managed cluster providers](#providers-managed)
  - [Configuring kubectl](#kubectl)

**Best practice:** For managed cluster providers, use the latest version of Kubernetes.
