# Upgrading the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_pak_mcm}}

You can upgrade only offline images that were used to install the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_pak_mcm}}.
{:shortdesc}

  * [Offline upgrade](#offline-upgrade)
    * [Supported upgrade paths](#supported-upgrade-paths)
    * [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
    * [Steps](#upgrade-steps)
    * [Post upgrade](#post-upgrade)
    * [Managed clusters](#managed-clusters)

## Offline upgrade
{: #offline-upgrade}

You can upgrade services by upgrading all deployed platform Helm charts.

### Supported upgrade paths
{: #supported-upgrade-paths}

You can upgrade only the following supported paths:

* {{site.data.keyword.cloud_pak_mcm}} on {{site.data.keyword.ocp}} version 1.1 to version {{site.data.keyword.version_cp}}

During the upgrade process, you cannot access the services management console.

### Prerequisites
{: #prerequisites}

* Optional. If you have subscriptions for deploying and managing application resources, update your subscription definition to use the expected local placement setting. For more information, see [Migrating subscriptions](../mcm/applications/migrate_subscriptions.md).

### Upgrade steps
{: #upgrade-steps}

1. Log in to the boot node as either a user with root permissions or a user with sudo privileges.
2. Download the installation files for IBM Cloud Pak for Multicloud Management 1.2. You must download the correct file or files for the type of nodes in your cluster. You can obtain these files from the [IBM Passport AdvantageÂ® ![Opens in a new tab](../images/icons/launch-glyph.svg "Opens in a new tab")](https://www.ibm.com/software/passportadvantage/) website.

    - For a {{site.data.keyword.linux_bit_notm}} cluster, download the `ibm-cp4mcm-core-1.2-x86_64.tar.gz` file.
    - For a {{site.data.keyword.ppc_notm}} cluster, download the `ibm-cp4mcm-core-1.2-ppc64le.tar.gz` file.

3. Extract the image and load them into Docker. Extracting the images might take a few minutes.
    - For {{site.data.keyword.ocp}} on {{site.data.keyword.linux_bit_notm}}:
        ```
        tar xf ibm-cp4mcm-core-1.2-x86_64.tar.gz -O | sudo docker load
        ```
        {: codeblock}

    - For {{site.data.keyword.ocp}} on {{site.data.keyword.ppc_notm}}:
        ```
        tar xf ibm-cp4mcm-core-1.2-ppc64le.tar.gz -O | sudo docker load
        ```
        {: codeblock}

4. Create an installation directory and copy the `cluster` directories from the previous installation directory to the new `cluster` folder. Use a different installation directory than you used for the previous version. For example, to store the configuration files in `ibm-multicloud-manager-1.2`, run the following commands:
    ```
    mkdir /opt/ibm-multicloud-manager-1.2
    cd /opt/ibm-multicloud-manager-1.2
    sudo cp -r /<installation_directory>/cluster .
    ```
    {: codeblock}

    **Note:** `/<installation_directory>` is the full path to your previous installation directory, and `/<new_installation_directory>` is the full path to your version 1.2.0 installation directory. It is not required to copy the entire image installation package from the previous version.

    You must set `multicluster-hub.etcd.accessModes` to `ReadWriteMany` in the `config.yaml` file, which is located in the `cluster` folder, if `multicluster-hub.etcd.persistence` is set to `true` and `multicluster-hub.etcd.accessModes` is not configured in the previous version. For example:
    ```
    multicluster-hub:
    etcd:
        persistence: true
        accessModes: ReadWriteMany
    ```
    {: codeblock}

5. Change to the `cluster` directory within your installation directory:
    ```
    cd /<new_installation_directory>/cluster
    ```
    {: codeblock}

6. Upgrade services by running the `upgrade` command:

    - For {{site.data.keyword.ocp}} on {{site.data.keyword.linux_bit_notm}}:
        ```
        sudo docker run -t --net=host -e LICENSE=accept -v $(pwd):/installer/cluster:z -v /var/run:/var/run:z -v /etc/docker:/etc/docker:z --security-opt label:disable ibmcom/mcm-inception-amd64:3.2.3 upgrade
        ```
        {: codeblock}

    - For {{site.data.keyword.ocp}} on {{site.data.keyword.ppc_notm}} (ppc64le):
        ```
        sudo docker run -t --net=host -e LICENSE=accept -v $(pwd):/installer/cluster:z -v /var/run:/var/run:z -v /etc/docker:/etc/docker:z --security-opt label:disable ibmcom/mcm-inception-ppc64le:3.2.3 upgrade
        ```
        {: codeblock}

    **Note:** If you want to get more logs from the command, you can add `-v` after the command to enable verbose mode (-vvv for more, -vvvv to enable connection debugging).

### Post upgrade

If you cannot view the {{site.data.keyword.gui}} after you complete the upgrade, complete the following steps:

1. Open the `platform-ui ingress` file:

      ```
      kubectl edit ingress platform-ui -n kube-system
      ```
      {: codeblock}

2. Edit the file by deleting the following line and saving it:

      ```
      icp.management.ibm.com/app-root: /console
      ```
      {: codeblock}
