# Creating a cloud connection

A *cloud connection* is required to create a Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster on a cloud service provider with Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes.
{:shortdesc}

The cloud connection stored the access credentials and configuration information for a cloud service provider. Each cloud service provider account requires its own cloud connection, as does each domain on a single cloud provider. 

The following files detail the information that is required for creating a connection document for each supported cloud provider:

- [Creating a cloud connection for Amazon Web Services](cloud_conn_aws.md)
- [Creating a cloud connection for Microsoft Azure](cloud_conn_aks.md)
- [Creating a cloud connection for Google Cloud Platform](cloud_conn_gke.md)
