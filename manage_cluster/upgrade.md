# Upgrading your cluster

After you create clusters that you want to manage with Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes, you can upgrade those clusters to the latest version by using the console.
{:shortdesc}

This method of upgrading only works for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters that are in a *Ready* state.

To upgrade your cluster, complete the following steps:

1. From the navigation menu, navigate to **Automate infrastructure** > **Clusters**. If an upgrade is available, it is shown in the *Installed version* column.

2. Select the clusters that you want to upgrade. **Remember:** A cluster must be in *Ready* state, and must be a Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clsuter to be upgraded with the console.

3. Select **Upgrade**.

4. Select the new version of each cluster.

5. Select **Upgrade**.
