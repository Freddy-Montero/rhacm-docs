You can create a cluster, delete a cluster, and more with Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes and Cluster API, a Kubernetes core-based API that is used to create, configure, and manage clusters with CRD and controller requirements. See the [Kubernetes Cluster API](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api) project for information about the API and the community.
