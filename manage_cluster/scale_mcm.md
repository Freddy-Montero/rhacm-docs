# Scaling your cluster

You can customize your cluster specifications, such as virtual machine sizes and number of nodes. See the following list of recommended settings for each available cloud provider, but also see the documentation for more specific information:

* [Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster in Amazon Web Services (AWS)](#ocp_aws)
* [Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud](#rhoks)
* [IBM Kubernetes Service cluster](#iks)
* [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](#gke)
* [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster](#aks)
* [Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)](#eks)

## Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster in Amazon Web Services (AWS)
{: #ocp_aws}

- Number of compute, worker, machines:
  
  ```
  compute.replicas: 3
  ```

- The number of control plane machines:

  ```
  controlPlane.replicas: 3
  ```

- Type of EC2 instance, including compute, memory and networking resources, for control plane machines and compute machines:

  ```
  controlPlane.platform.aws.type: m5.xlarge
  compute.platform.aws.type: m5.xlarge
  ```

See the Amazon documentation at [Amazon EC2 Instance Types](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/) for more details.

- Resizing:

After the cluster is created, you can resize your cluster to increase or decrease the number of nodes in that cluster. To learn how to resize your cluster, refer to [Creating a MachineSet to scale your cluster](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.1/machine_management/creating-machineset.html).

## Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud
{: #rhoks}

- Number of compute, worker, machines:

  ```
  compute.replicas: 3
  ```

- The number of control plane machines:
 
  ```
  controlPlane.replicas: 3
  ```

- Type of EC2 instance, including compute, memory and networking resources, for control plane machines and compute machines:

  ```
  controlPlane.platform.aws.type: m5.xlarge
  compute.platform.aws.type: m5.xlarge
  ```

See the documentation at [Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-clusters) for more details.

- Resizing:

After the cluster is created, you can resize your cluster to increase or decrease the number of nodes in that cluster. To learn how to resize your cluster, refer to [Creating a MachineSet to scale your cluster](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.1/machine_management/creating-machineset.html).

## IBM Kubernetes Service cluster
{: #iks}

- Number of worker nodes:
  
  ```
  workers: 1
  ```

See the _cloud.ibm.com_ documentation at [Planning your worker node setup](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-planning_worker_nodes) for more details.

- Type of Virtual Machine to create as Kubernetes worker nodes:

  ```
  machineType: "b3c.4x16.encrypted"
  ```
  
The `b3c.4x16.encrypted` machine type indicates that worker OS is Ubuntu 18.64, with 4 core, 16 GB memory, 25 GB primary disk, and 100 GB secondary disk.

The disk is AES 256-bit encrypted. 

Run `ibmcloud ks machine-types --zone <zone name>` for more details.

- Resizing:

After the cluster is created, you can resize your cluster to increase or decrease the number of worker nodes in that cluster. To learn how to resize your cluster, refer to [Adding worker nodes and zones to clusters](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-add_workers).

## Google Kubernetes Engine
{: #gke}

- The number of worker nodes:

  ```
  numNodes: 1
  ```

- The type of machine to use for nodes:

  ```
  machineType: "n1-standard-1"
  ```

Defaults to `n1-standard-1`. 
 
The list of predefined machine types is available by using the following command: `gcloud compute machine-types list`.

- Size for node VM boot disks:
   
  ```
  diskSize: "100G"
  ```

Defaults to 100 GB.

- Type of the node VM boot disk:
   
Defaults to `pd-standard`. Disk type must be `pd-standard`, or `pd-ssd`.

  ```
  diskType: "pd-standard"
  ```

After the cluster is created, you can resize your cluster to increase or decrease the number of nodes in that cluster.  To learn how to resize your cluster, refer to [Resizing a cluster](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/resizing-a-cluster).

## Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster
{: #aks}

- The number of worker nodes:
  
  ```
  nodeCount: 2
  ```

- The size of Virtual Machines to create as Kubernetes nodes. 

  ```
  nodeVMSize: "Standard_D8s_v3"
  ```

For more information, see [General purpose virtual machine sizes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/sizes-general).

- Resizing:
  
The typical size of the OS disk for each node in the node pool size range is between 100-2000GB. 

For more information or customization, see [Ephemeral OS disks for Azure VMs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/ephemeral-os-disks).

  ```
  nodeOsdiskSize: 100
  ```

After the cluster is created, you can resize your cluster to increase or decrease the number of nodes in that cluster. To learn how to resize your cluster, refer to [Scale the node count in an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/scale-cluster).

## Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)
{: #eks}
 
- The instance type for your worker nodes.
  
  ```
  nodeType: "t3.medium"
  ```


For more information, see [Amazon EC2 Instance Types](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types).


- The total number of worker nodes.

  ```
  nodes: 2
  ```

- The minimum number of nodes that your worker node Auto Scaling group can scale in to.

  ```
  nodesMin: 1
  ```

- The maximum number of nodes that your worker node Auto Scaling group can scale out to.

  ```
  nodesMax: 3
  ```

After the cluster is created, you can resize your cluster to increase or decrease the number of nodes in that cluster. To learn how to resize your cluster, refer to [Updating an Existing Worker Node Group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/update-stack.html).
