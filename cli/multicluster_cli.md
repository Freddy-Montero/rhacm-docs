# Using the multicluster plug-in (mc)

After you install the OpenShift Container Platform command-line interface (CLI), you can use the multicluster plug-in (mc) to view information about your clusters, manage your clusters, deploy applications, and more.

See the CLI [installation documentation](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.3/html/cli_tools/openshift-cli-oc) to install the OpenShift Container Platform command-line interface (CLI).
