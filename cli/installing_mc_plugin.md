# Installing the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_pak}} CLI (cloudctl) multicluster plug-in (mc)

The `mc` plug-in is not in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_pak}} CLI (cloudctl) installation. Complete the following procedure to download and install the plug-in to work with multiple clusters.

## Prerequisites

* You must install the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_pak}} CLI, `cloudctl`. For more information, see [Installing the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_pak}} CLI](../cloudctl/install_cli.md) to install the CLI.

## Installing the plug-in

1. Download the multicluster, or `mc` plug-in for the applicable operating system. See the list of the `mc` plug-in commands for the different operating systems:

  For macOS, run the following command:
  
  ```
  curl -kLo cloudctl-mc-plugin https://<Cluster Master Host>:<Cluster Master API Port>/rcm/plugins/mc-darwin-amd64
  ```
  {: codeblock}

  For {{site.data.keyword.ppc_notm}}, run the following command:
  
  ```
  curl -kLo cloudctl-mc-plugin https://<Cluster Master Host>:<Cluster Master API Port>/rcm/plugins/mc-linux-ppc64le
  ```
  {: codeblock}

  For {{site.data.keyword.linux_notm}}, run the following command:
  
  ```
  curl -kLo cloudctl-mc-plugin https://<Cluster Master Host>:<Cluster Master API Port>/rcm/plugins/mc-linux-amd64
  ```
  {: codeblock}

  For {{site.data.keyword.s390_notm}}, run the following command:
  
  ```
  curl -kLo cloudctl-mc-plugin https://<Cluster Master Host>:<Cluster Master API Port>/rcm/plugins/mc-linux-s390x
  ```
  {: codeblock}
    
2. Install the `mc` plugin for `cloudctl`. Run the following command to install the plug-in:

  ```
  cloudctl plugin install -f cloudctl-mc-plugin
  ```
  {: codeblock}

3. Verify that the `mc` plugin for `cloudctl` was successfully installed. Run the following command:
